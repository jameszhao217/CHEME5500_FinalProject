### Program Introduction





### Functions
-

-

- **pygame_script**:
This script sets up PyGame and generates a GUI to display the outputs from the command window. One interesting thing is that we defined some buttons for users to click on to enhance interactions. 


### How-to
Simply run the main_script, and follow the instructions to input the beam dimensions and loading information (pay close attention to the units specified). Then, a pop-up window will guide you towards the results.
